  "description": "Display warnings and severity levels of potential adverse interactions based on the data in the PHR Account Holder's medication and allergy list.",
  "purpose": "Drug interaction and drug interference checking is a responsibility of the prescribing provider. However, the PHR Account Holder may be taking new over-the-counter medications or new prescription medications from providers without access to e-prescribing and may want to check for interactions and/or interferences. A complete interaction and interference check would take into consideration other prescribed medications, over-the-counter medications, allergies, relevant health conditions, age, weight, gender, diet and nutrition (e.g., mineral supplements, grapefruit juice, or pomegranate juice), environmental factors (e.g., phototoxic skin reactions to sunlight), absorption considerations (e.g., calcium interference with drug absorption), timing considerations (e.g., take immediately before sleeping), activity considerations (e.g., take before performing physical exercise), and relevant laboratory values such as creatinine clearance and liver function tests.\r\n\r\nExample(s): Each time a new medication or a new allergy is entered into the PHR, perform an automated check for potential interactions among all of the current medication and allergy entries in the PHR.",

For example, the PHR Account Holder might desire to compare the medications that are prescribed by two members of the PHR Account Holder’s care team, in order to learn about potential adverse reactions. Each time a new medication or a new allergy is entered into the PHR, the PHR-S could perform an automated check for potential interactions among all of the current medication and allergy entries in the PHR. Also, the PHR-S could analyze possible reactions for medications that appear within “families” or classes of medications. A complete interaction and interference check would take into consideration other prescribed medications, over-the-counter medications, allergies, relevant health conditions, age, weight, gender, diet and nutrition (e.g., mineral supplements, grapefruit juice, or pomegranate juice), environmental factors (e.g., phototoxic skin reactions to sunlight), absorption considerations (e.g., calcium interference with drug absorption), timing considerations (e.g., take immediately before sleeping), activity considerations (e.g., take before performing physical exercise), and relevant laboratory values such as creatinine clearance and liver function tests."
