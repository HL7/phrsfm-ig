  "title": "PH.3.3 Manage Provider-Initiated Care Plans (Function)",
  "status": "active",
  "description": "Enable the PHR Account Holder to capture, record, and display Account Holder specific care plans received from authorized health care providers. An authorized health care provider's care plan(s) are typically provider-initiated, provider-defined, provider-rendered, and provider-implemented.",
  "purpose": "Care plans may encompass a wide variety of styles, goals, and complexities, grouped into three categories: health maintenance, health restoration, and chronic disease management. Examples of the three categories of care plans include:\r\n\r\n- Health Maintenance: The base care plan is a lifelong wellness plan that may specify age- and/or gender- specific health surveillance, an immunization schedule, and a diet and exercise program. It can be customized to accommodate specific health risks (such as hazardous exposures or genomic indicators).\r\n\r\n- Health Restoration: Natural conditions (such as pregnancy) or acute illnesses may occur that require the management of specific diagnostic and/or therapeutic measures.\r\n\r\n- Chronic Disease Management: Chronic disease care plans cover long term conditions (e.g., Type 1 diabetes).\r\n\r\nMultiple care plans, treatment plans, or health activities (including those that are self-generated) need to be managed/reconciled in order to enable the prioritization/reconciliation of care plans: based on relative health outcomes and risk, based on a timewise ordering of care plans, based on a condition-related ranking of care plans, based on changes to insurance coverage of health care plan services, or based on potential contraindications that arise from conflicting care plans goals or methods.\r\n\r\nThere might also be certain restrictions against sharing health information in the case of infants or teenagers who might require special health information exchange protections.\r\n\r\nExample(s): Capture and maintain a diabetic treatment plan that contains the pertinent staging details and multimodality plans in one place that can better coordinate the care by the diabetes-support team including the PHR Account Holder's Primary Care Provider.",
