  "description": "The system may serve as a communication tool to help control public health risks and promote population wellness, as well as to target conditions for a specific population demographic and the PHR Account Holder specifically.",
  "purpose": "A formal and well-defined communication channel between public health agencies and the PHR Account Holder's PHR-S is useful. It provides for monitoring public health threats through data and observations captured within the PHR-S. Additionally, it alerts the PHR Account Holder to take corrective actions in response to public health threats.\r\n\r\nExample(s): The system SHOULD provide the PHR Account Holder the ability to subscribe to population health web site information."
