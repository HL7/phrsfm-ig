  "description": "The system should capture and manage financial information related to the encounter.",
  "purpose": "Tracking the personal costs of healthcare can be complex. Charges are typically discounted by the insurance plan to allowed charges. They will pay a portion of allowed charges with the PHR Account Holder being responsible for the rest. A given encounter such as a hospitalization will have multiple charges from several providers. Capturing the Explanation Of Benefits from the insurance plan can help monitor the expenses.\r\n\r\nExample(s): The system should capture charge information and payment data from the Explanation Of Benefits (EOB) and associate it with the encounter records stored in the PHR-S.",
