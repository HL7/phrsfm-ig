  "description": "Manage the PHR Account Holder’s medication list.",
  "purpose": "Medication lists are managed over time, whether over the course of a visit or stay, or the lifetime of a patient. All pertinent dates, including medication start, modification, and end dates can be stored. Medication histories, (for example, alternative supplements, over-the-counter medications, and herbal medications) may be relevant for review. Medication lists are not limited to medication orders recorded by providers, but may include, for example, pharmacy dispense/supply records, patient-reported medications, and additional information such as age-specific dosage.\r\n\r\nExample(s): The system maintains a medication list that may be followed by the PHR Account Holder and referenced by his or her providers and pharmacists. Copies of the PHR medication list may be kept by their providers in their EHRs.",
