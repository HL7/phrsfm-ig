  "description": "Enable the PHR Account Holder to manage consent directives and authorizations.",
  "purpose": "A variety of consent directives and authorizations are needed to provide healthcare services. Each institution such as an emergency room, each provider, or each health care service such as an operative procedure may require its own informed consent be captured, displayed, and verified before care can be provided. The consent directives may be externally sourced with copies made available for the PHR Account Holder to capture and store. Some consent directives or authorizations may be authored by the PHR Account Holder granting authorizations such as a parent granting ad hoc authorization for emergency care for a child.\r\n\r\nNote: The system FM is agnostic to any specific consent/authorization approach. For example, consent/authorization directives may apply to the data in the PHR itself or could integrate with an external access control service.\r\n\r\nNote: A consent and privacy framework is best described in a functional profile (i.e., a subset) of the PHR-S FM and ought to be specified in accordance to organizational policy and/or jurisdictional law. Therefore, it is assumed that a consent and privacy model will be specified by the functional profile.\r\n\r\nExample(s): Maintain current authorizations in relation to specific health record functions. The PHR Account Holder may desire to see the authorizations associated with a specific clinical activity, such as treatment or surgery, along with that event in the PHR Account Holder's PHR-S.",
