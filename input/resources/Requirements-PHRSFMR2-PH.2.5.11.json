  "description": "Manage the PHR Account Holder’s nutrition and diet-related information.",
  "purpose": "Nutrition is related to health and wellness as well as chronic diseases. People want to record and monitor their food and nutrient intake including any nutritional supplements because they are trying to manage their weight, maintain their fitness level, or demonstrate progress towards the goals in their nutrition care plan. Diet and nutrient histories, (e.g., diet, nutritional supplements, enteral and parenteral feedings, vitamin and mineral supplements, history of breastfeeding, and other intake) may be relevant for review. Diet and nutrient lists are not limited to diet, enteral feeding, and vitamin and mineral supplement orders recorded by providers, but may include, for example, food and nutrient intake records, diet recommendations provided by a registered dietitian/nutritionist, and additional information such as weight, height, and Body Mass Index (BMI).\r\n \r\nExample(s): The system maintains a food and nutrition history list that may be followed by the PHR Account Holder and referenced by his or her providers and Registered Dietitians. Copies of the PHR food and nutrition history list may be kept by their providers in their EHR systems.\r\nExample(s): The system maintains a list of nutrition and diet-related information including food intake records, nutrient analysis summary records, energy balance data and nutrition care recommendations that may be followed by the PHR Account Holder and referenced by his or her providers including a Registered Dietitian.",

Therefore, the timing of medication administration need to carefully consider relative to other factors, such as food or supplement intake (or food or supplement withholding). For example, a PHR Account Holder who is pregnant could be informed that she should avoid consuming certain types of fish such as swordfish, shark or mackerel, and eat only limited amounts of tuna while pregnant due to the possibility of increased mercury exposure to the fetus. Another example, is that a person who is allergic to bananas, avocado, chestnut, and kiwi is also very likely to be allergic to latex. Another example is that a person who is on an anti-retroviral medication might need to wait one hour after taking the medication before ingesting calcium or magnesium supplements."
