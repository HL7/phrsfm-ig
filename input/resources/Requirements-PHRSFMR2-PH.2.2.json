  "purpose": "PHR Account Holder data can be collected from many sources (including administrative sources). For example, the PHR Account Holderâ€™s health insurance plan may directly offer health-related information or may enable the PHR system to derive selected clinical information from financial transactions to the extent that health insurance claims include relevant data. Similarly, selected medication records may be available from Pharmacy Benefits Management services.",

For example, one copy of a picture of a laceration may be hidden if two identical copies are received: one from the Emergency Response personnel and another from the Emergency Department."
