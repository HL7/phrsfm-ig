  "purpose": "The terms and conditions outline the sponsor requirements in using the application. The terms and conditions may include items such as copyright information, trademarks and intellectual property, third party links, indemnification, privacy, limitation of liability, term and termination and other miscellaneous provisions. The PHR Account Holder should be notified of the expectations of the sponsor and have the opportunity to agree to the requirements and any changes to the requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Conditions of Use document also helps indemnify the PHR sponsor against certain misuse of the data. For example, a published article on diabetes may contain a copyright notice that forbids the storage of that article on a computer without first paying for the article. The Conditions of Use document would inform the PHR Account Holder that the sponsor does not support copyright infringement.",
