  "status": "active",
  "description": "Manage the PHR Account Holderâ€™s health problem list and provide the ability to manage the problem list over time in accordance with organizational policy and/or jurisdictional law.",
  "purpose": "Problems are a core feature of the patient record that provides structure and direct management. Problems may include diagnoses. The PHR Account Holder, along with his or her (medical) advisors, may wish to establish their own guidelines regarding who can add or change self-entered problems on the primary list. The PHR Account Holder may wish to maintain his or her own list of problems authored themselves or from non-traditional providers that have no correlation in allopathic medicine. As in other criteria, all data must have source attribution so as to distinguish patient-entered data from provider-entered data.\r\n\r\nThe PHR Account Holder could have problems (or conditions) could be short-term or long-term. An example of a short-term condition is a febrile seizure or a single head injury; an example of a long-term condition is a genetic condition such as seizure-disorder (epilepsy) or repeated head trauma (e.g., professional boxing).\r\n\r\nProblem List information needs to be communicated to the care team because problem history information could influence the way that medications and therapies are prescribed.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the duration of the condition, the way that medications and therapies are prescribed by clinicians, as well as nutrient intake considerations, ought to be part of the PHR system. For example, a person who has a history of seizure(s) needs to share that information with relevant members of the care team throughout that person's lifetime.\r\n\r\nInformation about problems (or conditions) could be verified by diagnostic studies or collected via self-assessments.\r\n\r\nThe PHR Account Holder's problems (or conditions), either genetic or acquired, might cause contraindications with respect to medications, nutrients, or therapies. As a result, members of the care team may need to be informed during decision making activities. Members of the care team may also need to receive education regarding certain problems or conditions.\r\n\r\nExample(s): Problem list items may include: chronic conditions, diagnoses, allergies or intolerances, or symptoms, both past and present, as well as disability status or functional status and all pertinent dates, including date of onset, diagnosis, changes and resolution.",
