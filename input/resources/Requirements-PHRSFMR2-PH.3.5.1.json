  "description": "Provide a health calendar to record and display health care events.",
  "purpose": "A health calendar provides a method to view time related healthcare activity both in the future as scheduled events and in the past as historic events. It is a handy and well understood format. The calendar can also be used as a data input device, mimicking the paper calendar where clinical observations (such as gallbladder attacks or menstrual periods) can be written directly onto a calendar and captured as a timed note. This idea was put forward from usability studies with lay people how they would like to interact with their PHR.\r\n\r\nExample(s): IF a health calendar function is provided, THEN future appointments and other timed events SHOULD be displayed on the health calendar.",
