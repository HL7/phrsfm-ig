  "purpose": "PHR data, including personal observations and most specific data elements (such as allergies and intolerances or problems), may be entered directly by the PHR Account Holder. The source of all data is captured and, in this case, self-entered data, should be so labeled. These data elements may possess more or less credibility when entered by the PHR Account Holder. When appropriate, patient-entered data should be structured and codified.\r\n\r\nPaper-based information (such as a health card or a laboratory report) may be captured in the form of a scanned image and kept in the record, organized, and/or indexed for retrieval.\r\n\r\nExample(s): When a problem in the problem list is entered by the PHR Account Holder, it is labeled as such in order to distinguish this problem from others that resulted from a provider’s clinical diagnosis.",
