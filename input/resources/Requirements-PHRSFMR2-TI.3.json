  "description": "Enable the use of registry services and directories to uniquely identify, locate and supply links for retrieval of information related to:\r\n- patients and providers for healthcare purposes;\r\n- payers, health plans, sponsors, and employers for administrative and financial purposes;\r\n- public health agencies for healthcare purposes, and- healthcare resources and devices for resource management purposes.",
  "purpose": "Registry and directory service functions are critical to successfully managing the security, interoperability, and the consistency of the health record data across a PHR-S. These services enable the linking of relevant information across multiple information sources within, or external to, a PHR-S for use within an application. This applies to directories/registries internal to the PHR-S as well as directories/registries external to the PHR-S. Transmission may occur automatically or manually and may include small or large amounts of data. Directories and registries support communication between PHR Systems and may be organized hierarchically or in a federated fashion. For example, a patient being treated by a primary care physician for a chronic condition may become ill while out of town. The new provider's PHR-S interrogates a local, regional, or national registry to find the patient's previous records. From the primary care record, a remote PHR-S retrieves relevant information in conformance with applicable patient privacy and confidentiality rules.\r\n\r\nAn example of local registry usage is a PHR-S application sending a query message to the Hospital Information System to retrieve a patient's demographic data.",
