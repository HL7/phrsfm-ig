  "description": "Manage Updated Orders, Recommendations, or Alternative Care Plans.",
  "purpose": "The PHR Account Holder might need to receive updated orders or recommendations from care team members; or receive alternative care plan recommendations as the PHR Account Holder's conditions (or goals) change or when different modalities-of-care are recommended or chosen; or as elements of the PHR Account Holder's care plan change. For example, a physician might recommend an alternate drug if the physician notices that the price of the currently-prescribed drug increases dramatically or that the current drug is proving to be less effective than previously experienced. By accepting this new drug, the PHR Account Holder might then need to reconfigure the PHR system to present reminders for the PHR Account Holder to take the medication every third day instead of once-a-week.",
