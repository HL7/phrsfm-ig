  "description": "Allow the PHR Account Holder to manage the import to and export of data from a PHR-S.",
  "purpose": "A PHR Account Holder needs to prescribe how data is exchanged with other systems including how data is imported to the PHR-S, and the parameters for data export (e.g., who, when, or the extent of data). Some import and export functions may be one-time events; other exchanges, for example, may occur at regular intervals (such as via a subscription service). The PHR Account Holder should be able to determine the information or data that he/she will accept into the PHR. The system should record the acknowledgement or refusal of data sent to the Account Holder’s PHR-S. Use of exported data should be constrained according its intended and permitted purpose of use (e.g., as described in the PHR-S manufacturer's Terms of Service and Terms of Use agreements).\r\n\r\nExample(s): The PHR Account Holder may desire to inform her General Practitioner that the PHR Account Holder has received a proposed dietary regimen from a Registered Dietitian / Nutrition specialist. The PHR Account Holder may also desire to send a copy of the proposed nutrition care plan to the General Practitioner.",
