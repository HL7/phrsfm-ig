  "description": "Provide decision support tools (including clinical decision support, best practice guidelines and/or recommendations from payers, employers, researchers, professional associations, or public health organizations).",
  "purpose": "The system should aid the PHR Account Holder with making his or her self-assessments and treatment plans for self-care. Some decision support algorithms are straightforward and can be provided as part of the PHR-S service. Others may be more complex and are detailed in function PH.5.4 (Integration with Third Party Clinical Decision Support Services). For example, a child's weight and height can be plotted on a growth curve chart which graphically displays growth progress. Another example, is the ability for a pregnant woman to plot weight changes over time against a norm.",
