Interchange agreements enable partnering systems to discover, negotiate, and utilize those parameters/criteria. A PHR-S can use this information to define how data will be exchanged between the sending and the receiving partners. Interchange services and capabilities can be discovered in an automated fashion.\r\n\r\nEntity directories can be used to determine the address, profile, and data exchange requirements of known, and/or potential Interchange Agreement partners. Entity registries can be used to determine the security, addressing, and reliability requirements between potential Interchange Agreement partnering systems.",
