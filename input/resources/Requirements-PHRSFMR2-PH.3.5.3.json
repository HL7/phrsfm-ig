  "purpose": "The PHR Account Holder should have control of who has access to his or her PHR-S. All entities that send information to or request information from the PHR-S should be identified for proper authentication and authorization. The PHR Account Holder may establish specific access rights for each actor or groups such as all emergency room physicians. The list of actors may be used to capture contact information for those without digital capability as well. Potential actors may include but are not limited to: \r\n\r\n- PHR Account Holder Proxy\r\n- Trusted relatives, friends, and caregivers.\r\n- Healthcare providers that are part of the Account Holderâ€™s team.\r\n- Former providers and new providers not yet seen.\r\n- Insurance plans.\r\n- Pharmacy Benefits Manager, Pharmacies.\r\n- Public health registries.\r\n- Other registries including cancer, transplant and research.\r\n- Hospitals, laboratories and diagnostic imaging centers.\r\n\r\nAll PHR data is associated with a source and all sources should be identified and maintained as long as the data is maintained.\r\nAll entities making a request for information or receiving information should be identified.\r\n\r\nExample(s): Each provider should be registered before being granted access rights to the PHR-S.",
