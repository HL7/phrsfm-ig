  "status": "active",
  "description": "Support health risk alerts from authorized sources.",
  "purpose": "Alerts of a public health threat can be delivered by a Health Authority through a variety of channels, one of which can be to PHR Account Holders who provided prior consent for this service. The advantage of this modality is that the alerts can be prioritized to any special vulnerabilities of the PHR Account Holder based upon the Health Authorityâ€™s pre-existing claims data. More comprehensive background information and an action plan can then be included (such as alerts from government agencies regarding medications or devices).\r\n\r\nExample(s): Poor air quality alerts from governmental authorities are electronically sent to the registered PHR-S of a PHR Account Holder with a sensitive lung condition to take countermeasures.",
