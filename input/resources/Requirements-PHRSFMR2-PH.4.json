  "description": "Provide reliable education and information customized to the PHR Account Holder based on the information in the PHR to help the PHR Account Holder explore treatment or wellness options.",
  "purpose": "A wide variety of educational materials are available and the problem is to identify authoritative sources that provide relevant information for the PHR Account Holder's age, sex, job, medical conditions, wellness goals, and health literacy. The system should be able to take a request for information and screen the available libraries of educational materials against clinical information in the PHR-S (including social history such as work information) without inadvertently or unknowingly divulging personal health information to those other systems.\r\n\r\nExample(s):\r\n- Provide breast feeding instructions in alternate languages for a new mother.\r\n- Provide educational material on asbestos or pesticide exposure, or healthy habits for workers on a rotating shift, based on data about a person's job.",
