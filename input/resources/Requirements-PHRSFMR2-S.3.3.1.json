  "purpose": "The PHR Account Holder may have Consents and/or Authorization directives that allow or prohibit certain entities from access to part or all of the PHR. Directives may take different forms including documents or system flags on Consent Authorization. The Consent or Authorization requirements would be maintained in accordance with user role, organizational policy and/or jurisdictional law. Based on that, the Consent or Authorization might contain the details of the entity that may be authorized to use, or may be prohibited from using the PHR-S. The Consent or Authorization may detail to the record, field or class, the data available to be used or disclosed. The entities that the Consent or Authorization applies to may or may not be current PHR Account Holders of the PHR-S.",
