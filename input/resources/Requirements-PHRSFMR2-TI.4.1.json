  "status": "active",
  "description": "Employ approved standard terminologies to ensure data correctness and to enable semantic interoperability (both within an enterprise and externally).Support a formal standard terminology model.",
  "purpose": "Semantic interoperability requires standard terminologies combined with a formal standard information model. An example of an information model is the HL7 Reference Information Model. Another example is the ISO/EN 13606 Electronic Health Record Communication.\r\n\r\nA terminology provides semantic and computable identity to its concepts. Examples of terminologies that a PHR-S may support include: LOINC, SNOMED, ICD-9, ICD-10, and CPT-4.Terminologies are use-case dependent and may or may not be realm dependent. The key is that the standard be approved by all stakeholders. For example, terminologies for public health interoperability may differ from those for healthcare quality, administrative reporting, research, etc.\r\n\r\nFormal standard terminology models enable common semantic representations by describing relationships that exist between concepts within a terminology or in different terminologies, such as exemplified in the model descriptions contained in the HL7 Common Terminology Services specification.\r\n\r\nThe clinical use of standard terminologies is greatly enhanced with the ability to perform hierarchical inference searches across coded concepts. Hierarchical Inference enables searches to be conducted across sets of coded concepts stored in a PHR-S. Relationships between concepts in the terminology are used in the search to recognize child concepts of a common parent. For example, there may be a parent concept, 'penicillin containing preparations' which has numerous child concepts, each of which represents a preparation containing a specific form of penicillin (Penicillin V, Penicillin G, etc.). Therefore, a search may be conducted to find all patients taking any form of penicillin preparation.\r\n\r\nClinical and other terminologies may be provided through a terminology service internal or external to a PHR-S.",
