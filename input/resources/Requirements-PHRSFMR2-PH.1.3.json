  "description": "Enable the PHR Account Holder to add certain preferences that he or she wants health care providers to know.",
  "purpose": "PHR Account Holders may hold certain religious or philosophical views that impact how they wish to be treated or how they might respond to treatment choices. These preferences should be captured, prominently displayed, and made available during the care process. For example, a person may hold certain preferences regarding eating certain foods (e.g., avoidance of meats; preference for vegetables); taking certain therapeutic serums derived from animals; use of a pig-valve for valve replacement; use of human or animal tissues (e.g., skin tissue or bone).\r\n\r\nExample(s): A religiously-based proscription of blood transfusion is a commonly encountered example of a PHR Account Holder preference.",
