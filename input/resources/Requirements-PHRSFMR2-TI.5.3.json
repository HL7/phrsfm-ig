  "purpose": "A PHR-S often consists of multiple applications. Some of those applications may be within the PHR-S; others may be external to the PHR-S. The user of the PHR-S often benefits when those applications are integrated. Application integration can be accomplished in an ad-hoc fashion or in a standards-based fashion.\r\n\r\nThe method(s) by which applications may be integrated within an organization depends on that organization's approach to application integration. A given organization could conceivably employ multiple application integration approaches to meet various application integration requirements.",
