  "description": "Enable the PHR Account Holder to capture, read, update and remove access to health insurance benefit information including but not limited to past, current and future (if known) benefit plans.",
  "purpose": "Robust management features allow the PHR Account Holder to actively maintain their health insurance benefits information for selected benefits related to PHR Account Holder coverage needs. Over an extended period of time, with the likelihood of multiple insurance providers, it may be important for there to be information management capability for the varied payer sources, varied levels of benefit information, and varied levels of coverage including allowed coverages, exclusions, and limitations on specific coverages. Information management capabilities may include analytics regarding the PHR Account Holder's desired care such as: the selection of the most appropriate insurance plan for the current disease or injury; or the amount of deductibles that can be expected under varying insurance plans. Out-of-date or non-current insurance plan and benefit information can be used to compare different benefit packages, costs, and/or expenses over time resulting in a better understanding of health care as it pertains to health insurance coverage.",
