  "description": "Present the PHR Account Holder with reminders either sent by external sources or internally generated from information in the PHR-S.",
  "purpose": "The PHR Account Holder will want to manage reminders sent by external sources (such as the PHR Account Holder’s provider(s)) or generated from information in the PHR (such as guideline-based reminders, prescription refills, or appointment reminders). A reminder is a notification of an upcoming event or activity that usually requires an action by the PHR Account Holder. Reminders may be displayed on a view in the PHR (such as the summary dashboard) and may also be displayed by other electronic means (such sent to an e-mail account).\r\n\r\nExample(s): The system SHOULD send a reminder of an upcoming appointment as a text message to the PHR Account Holder’s cellular telephone.",
