  "description": "Enable the PHR Account Holder to respond to surveys on his or her healthcare experience.",
  "purpose": "This feature would enable providers, payers and PHR Account Holders to assess and provide feedback on areas such as the perceived patient-centeredness of care, satisfaction and performance, and the transparency efforts to improve quality of care. The receipt of a health survey does not imply that the member must participate in the survey. The system may simply direct the PHR Account Holder to a separate, external survey tool, or may provide the capacity to manage the entire survey process in which a member chooses to participate.",
