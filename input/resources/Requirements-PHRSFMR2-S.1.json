  "description": "The purpose of this section is to provide the system support to obtain a list of providers in an area and/or within a health plan panel and then maintain, or provide access to, current provider information.",
  "purpose": "From time to time the PHR Account Holder (or the PHR Account Holder's Proxy) may interact with various health care providers, provider organizations, members of health care teams, and/or health insurance coverage organizations. The PHR System could serve the PHR Account Holder by managing a readily-accessable central repository of certain information that would ease the burden of quickly recalling those people's and organizations' names, addresses, service offerings, medical specialties, performace ratings, prices, preferred communication methods (for example, phone or email address), or other identification information. Additionally, those entities and organizations may desire to contact the PHR Acoount Holder and offer notifications, incentives, wellness programs, and perhaps surveys regarding the PHR Acccount Holder's satifaction with the health care services delivered.\n\nExample(s):\nThe PHR System lists the phone number and business address of the PHR Account Holder's current and past primary care provider(s).\r\nThe PHR System receives an invitation from the PHR Account Holder's provider that extends an oppportunity for the PHR Account Holder to complete a survey describing the PHR Account Holder's satisfaction with the health care service delivered during a recent office visit."
