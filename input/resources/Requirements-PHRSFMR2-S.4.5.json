  "description": "Receive and validate formatted inbound communications to facilitate updating of PHR Account Holder reminder information from external sources such as Cancer or Immunization Registries.",
  "purpose": "Information from outside groups, such as immunization groups or public health organizations, may periodically have and send updates of value to PHR Account Holders. The system should be capable of generating reminders based on the recommendations of these organizations. Reminders could be provided to PHR Account Holders by a number of means, including alerts or system generated email. A record of such reminders may become part of a PHR Account Holderâ€™s record.\r\n\r\nExample(s): Reminders could include a recommended immunization, prophylactic guidelines for treating Mitral Valve Prolapse disorder, or PHR Account Holder self-testing for disease.",
