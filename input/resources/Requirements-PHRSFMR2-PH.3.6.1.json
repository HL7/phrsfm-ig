  "description": "Provide reporting to authorized public health agencies as required by applicable jurisdictional law.",
  "purpose": "Government authorities with the mandate of preserving the health of the population have a need for early detection of public health threats such as identifying the early stages of an avian flu pandemic. This may require periodic reporting of certain de-identified personal health information (PHI). Other epidemiological studies for public health issues as well as public or private medical research studies may also request de-identified PHI. Certain public health reporting requires identified PHI and contact information for urgent epidemiologic investigations and countermeasures (such as for a resistant Tuberculosis outbreak).\r\n\r\nNote: When transmitting de-identified bio-surveillance data to a Public Health system, the receiver should understand the possibility that a single case may be inadvertently counted twice: once as an identified case from an EHR system, and once as a de-identified case from a PHR system.\r\n\r\nExample(s): The system SHALL conform to function S.3.3.1 (Manage Consents and Authorizations) regarding epidemiological investigations of clinical health within a population.",
