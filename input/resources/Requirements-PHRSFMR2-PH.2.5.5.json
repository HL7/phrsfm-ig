  "purpose": "Immunization records can be maintained in the PHR-S. The list of immunizations can be associated with the health maintenance care plans in PH.1.3.3 maintaining a prospective immunization schedule for routine recommendations. In addition, vaccinations in preparation for foreign travel and episodic public health outbreaks such as bird flu vaccinations can be maintained here. Also, some jurisdictions accept titers or specific dates of infection as proof of adequate protection.\r\n\r\nImmunization information can be shared with national registries in order to support public health / population health stakeholder requirements.\r\n\r\nExample(s): The system SHOULD provide the ability to associate standard codes with discrete data elements associated with an immunization.",
