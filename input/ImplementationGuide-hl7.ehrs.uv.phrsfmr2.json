    "description": "Personal Health PHR-S functions are the subset of PHR-S functions that enable an individual to manage information about his or her healthcare. These functions provide direction as to the individual’s ability to interact with a Personal Health Record in such a way so as to individualize the record and maintain a current and accurate record of his or her healthcare activities. The functions include activities such as managing wellness, prevention and encounters. These functions are designed to encourage and allow an individual to participate actively in their healthcare and better access the resources that allow for self-education and monitoring.\r\nAll functions within the Personal Health Section have an identifier starting with “PH”."

Supportive PHR-S functions also provide input to systems that perform medical research, promote public health, and seek to improve the quality of healthcare delivered.\r\nAll functions within the Supportive Section have an identifier starting with “S”."

Note that there may be some functions more directly applicable to EHR systems than PHR systems.\r\n\r\nRI functions are core and foundational to all other functions of the Model (PH, S). RI functions may be implemented within the architecture of a single system or across a tightly coupled suite of systems (applications).

TI functions are core and foundational to all other functions of the Model (Care Provision, Care Provision Support, Population Health, Administrative Support and Record Infrastructure).
