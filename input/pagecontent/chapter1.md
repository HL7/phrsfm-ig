### PHR-S Functional Model Scope

The HL7 PHR-S FM defines a standardized model of the functions that may be present in PHR Systems.

It is beyond the scope of the PHR system to control the use (or intended use) of PHR data. On the contrary, it is within the scope of the PHR system to manage the authorization of an individual (or other application). Those parties are then responsible for using the data for appropriate (or intended) purposes. The system manufacturers ought to specify "intended and permitted use of PHR data" in their Terms of Service and Terms of Use agreements.

This Functional Model Is Not:

* A messaging specification
* An implementation specification
* A conformance specification
* A specification for the underlying PHR (i.e., the record itself)
* An exercise in creating a definition for a PHR
* A conformance or conformance testing metric
* A requirement specification for a single PHR system (see Anticipate Uses below)

The information exchange enabled by the PHR-S supports the retrieval and population of clinical documents and summaries, minimum data sets, and other input/outputs.
