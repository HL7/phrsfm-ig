Claiming Conformance to a Functional Profile

When a software vendor/developer wishes to claim (for their product) conformance to a version of a PHR-S Functional Profile the document claiming conformance should include the following information:

* The Name and Version of the standard with which the software product is conformant.
* A full listing of the functions and conformance criteria with which the software product is conformant.

In this manner any individual/organization evaluating the software product may easily determine its claimed functionality.

The documentation detailing the process of determining conformance using a tool shall include the name of the tool, the version of the tool and the date(s) of testing (e.g., “The software was tested using Tool-X on Conformance Criterion-Y”).

The process of claiming conformance to one or more Functional Profiles shall not be construed as creating a new Functional Profile.

If an end user suspects that a particular PHR-S product is not in compliance with a conformance criterion claimed in the software statement of conformance, the end user should first address the issue with the software vendor/manufacturer. The end user (provider) may also communicate their findings with the HL7 EHR Work Group. The EHR WG shall not be responsible for validation of any statement of conformance or for intervention with a software vendor/manufacturer when a discrepancy is reported by an end user, but at its discretion may contact the PHR-S vendor/manufacturer regarding the identified issue(s).
